        (/\u02c8s\u025blt.\u0259s/) (Lactuca sativa var. augustana, angustata, or
        asparagina), also called stem lettuce, celery lettuce, asparagus lettuce,
        or Chinese lettuce, is a cultivar of lettuce grown primarily for its thick
        stem or its leaves. It is used as a vegetable. In mainland China, the family
        is informally called woju (traditional Chinese: \u8435\u82e3; simplified Chinese:
        \u83b4\u82e3; pinyin: w\u014dj\u00f9), which is also the name of a cultivar.
        It is especially popular in both mainland China and Taiwan, where the stem
        is interchangeably called wosun (traditional Chinese: \u8435\u7b4d; simplified
        Chinese: \u83b4\u7b0b; pinyin: w\u014ds\u01d4n) or qingsun (\u9752\u7b4d;
        \u9752\u7b0b; q\u012bngs\u01d4n). \nThe pale green leaves, which are tender,
        and white stems can be eaten raw (in salads) or cooked. It can be pickled,
        grilled, roasted, or stir-fried. It is mild but nutty, with a slight smoky
        aftertaste. It is high in vitamins.Popular sources identify it as originating
        in the Mediterranean region and then being brought to China during the Tang
        dynasty, about A.D. 600\u2013900.It can be grown from seed and is sown from
        April through May in the Northern Hemisphere. The seeds can be planted in
        a set bed or a temporary nursery bed and then transplanted to the growing
        site. They should be spread 30 cm apart each way. The young (edible) leaves
        are ready about 4\u20135 weeks after planting and the edible stems are ready
        when about 30 cm tall. They are usually harvested between July and September.The
        plant can suffer from aphid attacks.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nThe
        stem is usually harvested at a length of around 15\u201320 cm and a diameter
        of around 3\u20134 cm. It is crisp, moist, and mildly flavored, and typically
        prepared by slicing and then stir frying with more strongly flavored ingredients.\nIn
        the US, celtuce is being used as a gluten-free pasta substitute.\n\n\n== See

        Atlantic hurricane season","extract":"The 2007 Atlantic hurricane season was
        the first season since 2003 to feature tropical activity both before and after
        the official bounds of the season. There were an above-average number of named
        storms during the season \u2013 15, however many storms were weak and short-lived.
        Despite the predominance of weak systems, this was the first season on record
        to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane. This would not
        happen again until 2017. It produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 tropical storms,
        six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. It officially started on June 1
        and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during
        which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean, although as shown
        by Subtropical Storm Andrea and Tropical Storm Olga in early May and early
        December, respectively, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at
        any time of the year. The first system, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed
        on May 9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December
        13. The most intense hurricane, Dean, was, at the time, the third most intense
        landfalling Atlantic storm on record. It was the second on record in which
        an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette,
        made landfall on the same day. September had a then record-tying eight storms,
        until it was surpassed in 2020. However, the strengths and durations of most
        of the storms were low.\nPre-season forecasts by Colorado State University
        called for 14 named storms and 7 hurricanes, of which three were expected
        to attain major hurricane status. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
        (NOAA) later issued its initial forecast, which predicted 13 to 17 named storms,
        7 to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. After several revisions
        in the projected number of storms, NOAA and CSU lowered their forecasts by
        the middle of the season.\nSeveral storms made landfall or directly affected
        land. Hurricanes Dean and Felix made landfall at Category 5 intensity, causing
        severe damage in parts of Mexico and Central America, respectively. Both storm
        names, as well as Noel, the name of a hurricane that affected the Caribbean,
        were retired from the naming list of Atlantic hurricanes. The United States
        was affected by five cyclones, although the storms were generally weak; three
        tropical depressions and only two tropical storms, Barry and Gabrielle, and
        one hurricane, Humberto, made landfall in the country. Elsewhere, three storms
        directly affected Canada, although none severely. The combined storms killed
        at least 478 people and caused about $3.42 billion (2007 USD$, 4.83 billion
        2024 USD) in damage.\n\n\n== Seasonal forecasts ==\nPhilip J. Klotzbach, William
        M. Gray, and their associates at Colorado State University issue forecasts
        of hurricane activity each year, separately from NOAA. Klotzbach''s team,
        formerly led by Gray, determined the average number of storms per season between
        1950 and 2000 to be 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes
        (storms exceeding Category 3 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale). A normal season,
        as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12 named storms, of which five to seven reach
        hurricane strength, and one to three become major hurricanes.\n\n\n=== Pre-season
        forecasts ===\nOn December 8, 2006, Klotzbach''s team issued its first extended-range
        forecast for the 2007 season, predicting above-average activity (14 named
        storms, seven hurricanes, three of Category 3 or higher). It listed a 64 percent
        chance of at least one major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland. This included
        a 40 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the East Coast,
        including the Florida peninsula, and a 40 percent chance of at least one such
        strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward. The potential
        for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast to be above average,
        and the team predicted that El Ni\u00f1o, associated with reduced hurricane
        activity in the Atlantic, would dissipate by the active portion of the season.On
        April 3 a new forecast was issued, calling for a very active hurricane season
        of 17 named storms, nine hurricanes and five intense hurricanes. The increase
        in the forecast was attributed to the rapid dissipation of El Ni\u00f1o conditions.
        The team also forecast a neutral or weak-to-moderate La Ni\u00f1a and noted
        that sea surface temperatures were much higher than average. The estimated
        potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was increased
        to 74 percent; the East Coast potential increased to 50 percent, and from
        the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability rose
        to 49 percent. However, the team''s report noted that while they predicted
        an active season, it was not suggesting that 2007 would be \"as active as
        the 2004 and 2005 seasons\".\n\n\n=== Midseason outlooks ===\nOn June 19 the
        UK Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of 10 tropical storms in the July to
        November period with a 70 percent chance that the number would be in the range
        of 7 to 13. On August 3, 2007, Klotzbach''s team lowered its season estimate
        to 15 named storms, of which eight were to become hurricanes and four to become
        major hurricanes. Team members noted that conditions had become slightly less
        favorable for storms than earlier in the year. Sea surface temperature anomalies
        were cooler, and several Saharan Air Layer events had suppressed development
        of tropical cyclones. El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions
        were also noted to have been slightly cooler.On August 9, 2007, NOAA revised
        its season estimate slightly downwards to 13 to 16 named storms, of which
        seven to nine were to be hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes. However,
        the agency reaffirmed its prediction of an above-average season, citing warmer-than-normal
        sea surface temperatures in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean and
        the likelihood of La Ni\u00f1a conditions during the peak of the season.\n\n\n==
        Seasonal summary ==\n\nOnly two major hurricanes\u2014storms of Category 3
        intensity or higher\u2014formed during the season, the least since the 1997
        season, although tied with the 2006 and 2002 seasons. Named storms were active
        for 33.50 days during the season, the lowest number of active days since the
        1994 season. There were only 11.25 days with active hurricanes, the lowest
        value since the 2002 season. Despite this, the number of days with major hurricanes
        was above the long-term average. Four named storms made landfall on the U.S.
        during the year, but damage from those storms totaled to only about $82 million
        (2007 USD); this was the least damage the U.S. saw from any Atlantic hurricane
        season since the 1990 season. The season was one of only six Atlantic hurricane
        seasons to produce two Category 5 equivalent hurricanes, the others being
        the 1932, 1933, 1961, 2005, 2017, and 2019 seasons. The two Category 5 hurricanes,
        Dean and Felix, both reached Category 5 strength on two separate occasions,
        and both made landfall at Category 5 intensity, making the 2007 season the
        first to feature two hurricanes doing each, both of which would not be repeated
        until 2017. When Hurricane Felix was upgraded to a Category 5 storm on September
        2, it became the eighth to form in this basin since 2000. This gave the decade
        more hurricanes of such strength than any other on record. Hurricane Humberto
        was the first hurricane to make landfall in Texas since Hurricane Claudette
        in 2003.Overall, the season''s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated
        cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 74, which is below the long-term average of
        93, and the lowest since 2002. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the
        power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms
        that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high
        ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or
        exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although
        officially, subtropical cyclones, such as Andrea or the initial portions of
        Gabrielle, Jerry, and Olga, are excluded from the total, the figure above
        includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.\n\n\n== Systems
        ==\n\n\n=== Subtropical Storm Andrea ===\n\nThe first storm of the season,
        Subtropical Storm Andrea, originated from a large extratropical cyclone that
        formed off the mid-Atlantic coast on May 6. It deepened steadily along a cold
        front that pushed through Florida. When the system lost most of its baroclinic
        support, development ceased until its low moved into warmer waters near the
        Bahamas. However, interaction between the low and a strong high-pressure system
        to the north generated hurricane-force winds in the system. Decreasing vertical
        wind shear allowed the storm to generate deeper convection much closer to
        the center. By May 9 the previously extratropical cyclone had transformed
        into Subtropical Storm Andrea while located about 140 miles (225 km) southeast
        of Savannah, Georgia. Andrea began its subtropical phase as it was weakening,
        and continued this deterioration as it moved southward into an environment
        with higher wind shear. By May 11, Andrea had lost all significant convection
        and degenerated into a remnant low. Though it produced intermittent bursts
        of convection, Andrea''s chance of regeneration was extinguished when an advancing
        cold front pushed it northward and eventually absorbed the system.Andrea was
        short-lived, dissipating on May 11. It was the first pre-season storm to develop
        since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003 and the first Atlantic named storm
        in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981. Six people drowned along the Southeast
        U.S. Coast. However, because Andrea never made landfall, most of the resulting
        damage was associated with large waves, higher than normal tides, associated
        coastal flooding, and beach erosion caused by the storm.\n\n\n=== Tropical
        Storm Barry ===\n\nOn June 1, Tropical Storm Barry developed on the first
        day of the hurricane season. It originated from a trough of low pressure in
        the southeastern Gulf of Mexico that previously formed in the northwestern
        Caribbean. It accelerated to the northeast before reaching a peak intensity
        of 997 mbar and making landfall on Florida. Barry dissipated on June 2. In
        Florida, the rainfall resulted in slick roads, which caused two traffic-related
        deaths, and a woman was killed after being injured by rough surf.\n\n\n===
        Tropical Storm Chantal ===\n\nAfter two months of inactivity, an area of low
        pressure formed near the Bahamas on July 28 and gradually began to organize
        while moving north-northeast. On July 30 it was classified as Tropical Depression
        Three and was named Tropical Storm Chantal shortly thereafter while south
        of Nova Scotia. The storm weakened on August 1 and made landfall on Newfoundland;
        it later tracked into the North Atlantic as an extratropical storm.Chantal
        moved over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland where flooding was observed,
        where about 4 inches (100 mm) of rain caused the postponement of the annual
        Royal St. John''s Regatta. Insured damage across the area totaled $5.8 million
        (2007 CAD; $5.5 million 2007 USD$, 7.76 million 2024 USD).\n\n\n=== Hurricane
        Dean ===\n\nOn August 11, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa,
        and, encountering favorable conditions, quickly spawned Tropical Depression
        Four, roughly 520 miles (835 km) west-southwest of Cape Verde. The depression
        moved briskly westward, south of a deep layered ridge, and was upgraded to
        Tropical Storm Dean on August 14. The storm continued to strengthen overnight
        as it gained organization, and became the first hurricane of the season on
        August 16. On August 17 the eye of the hurricane passed into the Caribbean
        between the islands of Martinique and Saint Lucia as a Category 2 hurricane.In
        the warm waters of the Caribbean, Dean rapidly strengthened into a Category
        5 hurricane with 165 mph (266 km/h) sustained winds. This made it the strongest
        Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma\u2014and it was tied for the seventh
        most intense Atlantic storm of all time. An eyewall replacement cycle weakened
        Dean, which then passed just south of Jamaica as a Category 4 hurricane. Dean
        regained Category 5 status late on August 20 and at that strength it made
        landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico near Costa Maya on August
        21. Dean was the first storm to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in
        the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. A dropsonde in the eye
        of the storm estimated a central pressure of 905 mbar, tying Dean with Hurricane
        Mitch for the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. Dean
        was the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the
        Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988). Dean weakened
        over land, but re-intensified slightly in the Gulf of Mexico. It made its
        final landfall near Tecolutla, Veracruz on August 22, dissipating the next
        day.In Hispaniola, Dean killed 15 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
        Dean also left $616 million (2007 USD$, 869 million 2024 USD) in damage on
        Martinique and $154 million (2007 USD$, 217 million 2024 USD) on Guadeloupe.
        In Mexico, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August
        21 as a Category 5 hurricane. Throughout its track, Dean killed 44 people
        and caused several billion dollars in damage.\n\n\n=== Tropical Storm Erin
        ===\n\nTropical Storm Erin formed on August 16 in the Gulf of Mexico from
        a persistent area of convection. Based on reconnaissance data received from
        an NOAA plane investigating the depression, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm
        Erin on August 15. It weakened to a tropical depression as it made landfall
        near Lamar, Texas, on August 16, and the NHC issued its last advisory on the
        system shortly thereafter as it moved inland. Early on August 19 after entering
        Oklahoma, the remnants of Erin suddenly re-intensified to maximum sustained
        winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) a short distance west of Oklahoma City.The storm
        flooded more than 40 homes and businesses. Along its path into the central
        states, Erin killed 16 people\u20149 directly\u2014and left about $25 million
        (2007 USD$, 35.3 million 2024 USD) in total damage.\n\n\n=== Hurricane Felix
        ===\n\nAn area of disturbed weather east of the Windward Islands was designated
        Tropical Depression Six on August 31. Early on September 1, it was named Tropical
        Storm Felix, and it was upgraded to a hurricane later that day. Tracking generally
        westward, it rapidly intensified to Category 5, and after fluctuating in strength,
        made landfall on Nicaragua with 160 mph (260 km/h) winds. At least 133 deaths
        and more than $50 million (2007 USD) in damage have been attributed to Felix.
        With Felix, the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season became the first known to include
        two hurricanes making landfall at Category 5; hurricanes Irma and Maria made
        landfall at Category 5 intensity during the 2017 Atlantic season.Felix took
        a similar path as Hurricane Dean though a bit further south, although its
        effects were not severe; damage on Tobago was estimated at $250,000 (2007
        TTD; $40,000 2007 USD$, 56,453 2024 USD). Felix made landfall just south of
        the border between Nicaragua and Honduras, in a region historically known
        as the Mosquito Coast, as a Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph (260 km/h) winds
        on September 4. Residents of the region were reported to have been given little
        warning of the oncoming hurricane, which left many fisherman stranded at sea.
        In all, Felix killed at least 130 people, and damage in Nicaragua totaled
        C$869.3 million (2007 NIO; $46.7 million 2007 USD$, 65.9 million 2024 USD).\n\n\n===
        Tropical Storm Gabrielle ===\n\nA cold front that moved off the southeastern
        coast of the United States on September 1 developed a weak low over the waters
        near Georgia. The low drifted eastward and weakened over the next few days
        until it joined with convection from an upper-level trough that had been moving
        over the western Atlantic. On September 8, the center of circulation became
        sufficiently organized to be declared Subtropical Storm Gabrielle, about 360
        nautical miles (670 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras. For the next twelve hours,
        the system''s strongest winds and thunderstorms remained separated from the
        center. On September 8 new convection eventually united with the center, leading
        the transition of Gabrielle into a tropical storm. Gabrielle gradually strengthened
        as it traveled northwest towards North Carolina and Virginia. The storm reached
        its peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) just before it arrived in Cape Lookout,
        though strong wind shear kept most of the convection and surface winds offshore.
        Gabrielle weakened over land, and moved back into the Atlantic on September
        10. The circulation deteriorated further, and the storm dissipated southwest
        of Nova Scotia the next day.In advance of the storm, tropical cyclone watches
        and warnings were issued for coastal areas, while rescue teams and the U.S.
        Coast Guard were put on standby. The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its
        immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere. Along the
        coast, high waves, rip currents, and storm surge were reported. Slight localized
        flooding was reported. Gusty winds also occurred, though no wind damage was
        reported. Overall damage was minor, and there were no fatalities.\n\n\n===
        Tropical Storm Ingrid ===\nA large tropical wave exited Africa on September
        6 and initially failed to develop due to strong easterly shear. On September
        9, a broad low-pressure area developed about midway between Africa and the
        Lesser Antilles. The wind shear slowly weakened, and early on September 12
        Tropical Depression Eight developed about 1125 miles (1815 km) east of the
        Lesser Antilles. The system moved west-northwestward due to a ridge to its
        north, and with continued wind shear, it remained a tropical depression for
        24 hours before convection increased further. Early on September 13 it intensified
        into Tropical Storm Ingrid, reaching peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Operationally,
        it was not upgraded to a tropical storm until that evening.Ingrid remained
        a tropical storm until September 15, when it weakened to a tropical depression
        due to high shear from a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough. Gradual
        weakening continued as it passed northeast of the Leeward Islands. Ingrid
        briefly reorganized on September 16, before weakening further and degenerating
        into an open wave early on September 17. The remnants turned northwestward
        within the low-level steering flow, and dissipated on September 18 without
        redevelopment. There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with
        Ingrid because the storm never threatened land.\n\n\n=== Hurricane Humberto
        ===\n\nOn September 12, an area of thunderstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico
        organized into Tropical Depression Nine, about 60 mi (97 km) southeast of
        Matagorda, Texas. Within three hours of forming, it was named Tropical Storm
        Humberto, and it turned to the north-northeast before rapidly intensifying.
        In the early morning hours of September 13, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found
        that Humberto had strengthened into a hurricane while located about 15 miles
        (20 km) off the coast of Texas. Humberto quickly weakened and entered Southwest
        Louisiana as a tropical storm during the afternoon of September 13, dissipating
        the next day.Humberto caused some structural damage on High Island and widespread
        tree and power line damage in the Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur area. Power outages
        caused four oil refineries to halt production in Beaumont. One person was
        reported dead as a result of the storm, a Bridge City man killed when his
        carport crashed on him outside his house. Damage was estimated at $50 million.\n\n\n===
        Tropical Depression Ten ===\n\nA subtropical depression formed on September
        21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave,
        the tail end of a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing
        a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system
        transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the
        center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton
        Beach early on September 22, and shortly thereafter it dissipated over southeastern
        Alabama.It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area
        after the destructive 2005 hurricane season and Hurricane Katrina. Overall
        impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However,
        the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where
        20 houses were destroyed and 30 more were damaged. Damage was estimated at
        $6.2 million.\n\n\n=== Tropical Storm Jerry ===\nThe origins of Jerry were
        from a non-tropical low-pressure area over the central Atlantic on September
        21. The system meandered for two days, gradually developing deeper convection
        and gaining organization. On September 23, the National Hurricane Center declared
        it a subtropical depression, as a warm core had developed but the system was
        still involved with an upper-level low, and its strongest winds were well
        removed from the center. Early on September 23, both satellite estimates and
        QuikScat data determined that the depression had strengthened into Subtropical
        Storm Jerry, despite the lack of a well-defined inner core.The storm slowly
        acquired tropical characteristics including a better-defined warm core, and
        Jerry became fully tropical that evening as a weak and sheared tropical storm
        with 40 mph (65 km/h) winds over a small radius. It accelerated northeastward
        over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C).
        On September 24, it weakened to a tropical depression ahead of a powerful
        cold front with little deep convection remaining in the system. That evening,
        a QuikScat pass determined that Jerry opened up into a trough, which was being
        absorbed into the larger frontal system. It completely dissipated by early
        on September 25. Jerry never approached land during its lifespan, and no damage
        or casualties were reported.\n\n\n=== Hurricane Karen ===\nA very large tropical
        wave accompanied by a large envelope of low pressure emerged from the coast
        of Africa on September 21. As it moved westward, deep convection gradually
        increased over the disturbance as its broad low-level circulation became better-defined.
        By September 24, as the system traveled northwestward it organized enough
        to become a tropical depression. Six hours later the depression was upgraded
        to Tropical Storm Karen.Karen''s organization and intensity remained steady
        for the next day. Early on September 26, however, the storm strengthened significantly.
        In post-operational analysis the cyclone was determined to have reached hurricane-strength
        for about twelve hours. However, strengthening was short-lived because a sharp
        upper-level trough to the west of Karen increased the amount of vertical wind
        shear over the hurricane. By September 28 these unfavorable conditions had
        weakened Karen to a marginal tropical storm and left its large low-level circulation
        exposed. Meanwhile, the storm began heading northward and experiencing intermittent
        bursts of deep convection. However, the relentless wind shear exposed the
        system''s circulation until it dissipated in the mid-Atlantic on September
        29. Karen''s remnants lingered near the Leeward Islands for the next few days,
        although the system never directly affected land. As a result, no reported
        damages or casualties were associated with Karen.\n\n\n=== Hurricane Lorenzo
        ===\n\nA tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on September
        11, traversed the Caribbean and crossed the Yucat\u00e1n on September 21.
        The disturbance developed a small surface low on September 24 while moving
        erratically over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Strong upper-level winds
        initially prevented the system from developing convection; however, the shear
        relaxed on the following day and convection increased. On the evening of September
        25, a hurricane hunter aircraft found evidence that the low qualified as a
        tropical depression. Under weak steering currents, the depression drifted
        south and southwest, executing a small cyclonic loop into the Bay of Campeche.
        Upper-level winds gave way to an anticyclone above the depression, and the
        system became Tropical Storm Lorenzo on September 27 about 130 nautical miles
        (240 km) east of Tuxpan. Rapid intensification brought Lorenzo to hurricane
        status early that evening, less than twelve hours after becoming a tropical
        storm. Lorenzo reached its peak intensity on September 28, then weakened slightly
        before making landfall near Tecolutla, Mexico as a minimal hurricane. The
        small circulation weakened rapidly after landfall, and the system dissipated
        the next day.Six deaths in Mexico were attributed to Lorenzo, mostly due to
        flash floods and mudslides. The states of Puebla and Veracruz reported damage
        from rain and high winds. Two hundred people were forced to evacuate in Hidalgo
        when the San Lorenzo River overflowed its banks. Lorenzo made landfall in
        virtually the same location that Hurricane Dean had struck a month earlier.
        Damage was estimated at $1 billion (2007 MXN; $92 million 2007 USD$, 130 million
        2024 USD).\n\n\n=== Tropical Storm Melissa ===\nOn September 26, a tropical
        wave exited Africa and quickly developed a low-pressure area. Following a
        convective increase and better-defined outflow, it developed into Tropical
        Depression Fourteen about 115 miles (185 km) west-southwest of the southernmost
        Cape Verde Islands early on September 28. Because the depression was isolated
        from the subtropical ridge, the depression drifted west-northwestward. Westerly
        wind shear prevented significant development, but following an increase in
        convection, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Melissa early on
        September 29. Similar to previous storms Ingrid and Karen, high wind shear
        in the deep tropics hindered Melissa''s development, and its peak winds were
        only 40 mph (65 km/h); operationally, satellite imagery suggested the storm
        reached 45 mph (72 km/h). By September 30, the shear and cooler waters weakened
        Melissa to a tropical depression with a poorly defined surface center. The
        system lost its deep convection and by that afternoon, Melissa degenerated
        into a remnant low. It continued west-northwestward, producing intermittent
        convection, until being absorbed by a front northeast of the Lesser Antilles
        on October 5. There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with
        Melissa.\n\n\n=== Tropical Depression Fifteen ===\nAn area of disturbed weather
        extended from the northwestern Caribbean to the western Atlantic Ocean on
        October 4, possibly related to the remnants of Hurricane Karen. The system
        slowly organized, developing a surface low pressure on October 8 to the northeast
        of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Convection associated with the storm steadily
        increased as the low moved towards the northeast. By October 11, the low organized
        into Tropical Depression Fifteen about 740 mi (1,190 km) east-southeast of
        Bermuda, after the convection had persisted for about 12 hours. An upper-level
        low to the west caused strong southwesterly wind shear, which inhibited development.On
        October 12, a building ridge caused the depression to slow at the same time
        as the convection began decreasing. The storm''s center became exposed as
        the deep convection became limited to a few small cells north of the center.
        By that afternoon, the depression degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant
        low persisted for the next several days while picking up speed and taking
        a gradual turn towards the northeast. The low transitioned into an extratropical
        cyclone on October 14 and intensified, moving through the Azores with gale-force
        winds. It reached winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before being absorbed by a larger
        extratropical storm on October 18.\n\n\n=== Hurricane Noel ===\n\nDuring the
        evening of October 27, a low-pressure system that had been slowly developing
        over the eastern Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Sixteen. On
        the next day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Noel, and made landfall
        on Haiti on October 29. Noel meandered across the western Caribbean for the
        next three days, intensifying into a hurricane on November 1. Tracking northward,
        Noel began its transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 2, becoming
        fully extratropical on November 4 while over Labrador. As a powerful extratropical
        cyclone, Noel crossed back into the Atlantic and began a track towards western
        Greenland.Throughout the Caribbean, Hurricane Noel caused severe damage. Torrential
        rainfall and mudslides caused by the storm killed at least 87 people in the
        Dominican Republic and at least 73 in Haiti. Noel generated winds of 130 mph
        (210 km/h) in the Wreckhouse region of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n\n===
        Tropical Storm Olga ===\n\nIn the second week of December, after the official
        end of the hurricane season, a low developed east of the northernmost Lesser
        Antilles. It slowly acquired tropical characteristics, and late on December
        10, the National Hurricane Center declared it Subtropical Storm Olga while
        just north of Puerto Rico. It is the first post-season storm since Tropical
        Storm Zeta in the 2005 season. Olga was only one of a few out of season tropical
        cyclones to make landfall. The storm made landfall on December 11 on the eastern
        tip of the Dominican Republic. Later that evening, Olga transitioned into
        a tropical storm just after making landfall. Olga tracked over Hispaniola
        and emerged in the Caribbean. Strong wind shear and dry air caused Olga to
        weaken into a remnant low early on December 13.The storm impacted many areas
        affected by Tropical Storm Noel a month earlier. In Puerto Rico, moderate
        rainfall caused one death. According to the National Hurricane Center''s Tropical
        Cyclone Report on Olga, at least 22 occurred due to the release of floodgates
        at a dam in Santiago Province. Two deaths were also reported in Haiti, and
        one fatality was confirmed in Puerto Rico. Almost 12,000 homes were damaged,
        of which 370 were completely destroyed.\n\n\n== Storm names ==\n\nThe following
        list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic
        in 2007. This is the same list used for the 2001 season, except for Andrea,
        Ingrid, and Melissa, which replaced Allison, Iris, and Michelle, respectively.
        Each of the new names was first used in 2007. The names not retired after
        the season were used for the 2013 season.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\nOn May
        13, 2008, at the 30th Session of the World Meteorological Organization''s
        Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee, the WMO retired the names Dean,
        Felix, and Noel from its Atlantic hurricane name lists, and they will not
        be used again for another Atlantic hurricane. They were replaced with Dorian,
        Fernand, and Nestor for the 2013 season.\n\n\n== Season effects ==\nThis is
        a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.
        It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas
        affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and
        indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but
        were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the
        storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are
        in 2007 USD.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTropical cyclones in 2007\n2007 Pacific
